# Hi, hope you enjoy the code.
<p>Actually, I solved the problem in four different ways, and the only way I can determine if one of them is actually better than another needs math, and actually, I'm not going to go through this for the sake of math but for looking for the advantage and disengage of them!</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Solution 1 (my faword one)</p>
    <span>
      back to the school, the first algrithms i designed was this to solve this perticuler proplem, and i was very happy of since i thought i could better then my firents solution in which most of them solved using arrays. 
      so i'm going to assume the size of input is (N) so the function "fiboForward" will need n opeation on then to solve and 
      then we got O(N) if the input is gretter than 2 but if not then it will only that constant time O(1)

  </li>
  </ul>
